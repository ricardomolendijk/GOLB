# Go Load Balancer Template

This project is a template for building a robust load balancer using Go. It includes several features and integrations to help you get started quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Backend Management**: Easily manage different backend servers. The template is designed to be flexible and can be extended to support various backend configurations and health checks.

- **Dynamic Layered Logging**: Utilize a logging agent to implement dynamic, layered logging. Logs can be written to disk, providing a comprehensive logging solution that is both powerful and easy to use.

- **Error Handling**: The template includes good practices for error handling, ensuring that your load balancer functions are robust and reliable. It provides a structured way to manage and log errors, making debugging and maintenance easier.

- **Dockerized**: The project is fully dockerized, allowing for easy deployment and scaling. You can build and run your load balancer in a consistent environment, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.

- **Kubernetes Ready**: The template is ready to be deployed on Kubernetes, providing scalability and high availability. It includes configurations and best practices for running your load balancer in a Kubernetes cluster.

- **CI/CD Ready**: The project is set up for continuous integration and continuous deployment, enabling automated testing and deployment. This ensures that your code is always in a deployable state and can be released to production with confidence.
